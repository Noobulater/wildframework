-- JUST A LITTLE NOTE. 
-- these hooks are meant to be overridden by the game, they are merely
-- a way I can link certain systems (like achievements) so that they can monitor
-- and take stats of things that happen in the game. This is useful when trying to 
-- calculate how well players did at the end of a game, and/or round. 


-- A list of hooks, they are used like the gamemode hooks
